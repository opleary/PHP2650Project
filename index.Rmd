# Predicting Survival and Controlling for Bias with Random Survival Forests and Conditional Inference Forests

## What is Survival Analysis?

The main goal of survival analysis is to analyze and estimate the expected amount of time until an event of interest occurs for a subject or groups of subjects. Originally, survival analysis was developed for the primary use of measuring the lifespans of certain populations. However, over time its utilities have extended to a wide array of applications even outside of the domain of healthcare. Thus, while biological death continues to be the main outcome under the scrutiny of survival analysis, other outcomes of interest may include time to mechanical failure, time to repeat offense of a released inmate, time to the split of a financial stock and more! Time in survival analysis is relative and all subjects of interest are likened to a common starting point at baseline (t = 0) with a 100% probability of not experiencing the event of interest.

Subjects are observed from baseline to some often pre-specified time at the end of study. Thus, not every subject will experience the event of interest within the observational period's time frame. In this case, we don't know if or when these subjects will experience the event, we just know that they have not experienced it during the study period. This is called **censoring**, more specifically, right-censoring. Right censoring is just one of multiple forms of censoring that survival data strives to adjust for and the form that we will focus on in this comprehensive review. Dropout is also a form of right censoring. The event of interest can happen during the specified time frame, outside of the time frame, or not at all but we don't know which scenario applies to the individuals that leave the study early.

![*Right censoring occurs when a subject enters the study before experiencing the event of interest at time = 0 and leaves the study without experiencing the event either by not staying the full observational time, or staying the full time without having the event occur.*](img/right_cens_img.png){width="592"}

It's imperative that we still consider these censored observations in our study instead of removing them so that we don't bias our results towards only those individuals that experienced the event of interest within the observational time frame. Thus, in survival analysis, not only do we include time from baseline at event of interest, but we also include a binary variable indicating whether an individual experienced the event or was censored instead.

In standard survival analysis, the **survival function**, S(t) is what defines the probability that the event of interest has **not** yet happened at time = t.

```{r}

# <div align="center"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large S(t) = P(T > t)"></div>

```

S(t) is non-increasing and ranges between 0 and 1. The hazard function on the other hand is defined as the instantaneous risk of an individual experiencing the event of interest within a small time frame.

```{r}

## <div align="center"><img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large h(t) = lim_{\delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{Pr(t \le T \le t + \delta t | T> t)}{\delta t}"></div>

```

Both survival functions and hazard functions are alternatives to probability density functions and are better suited for survival data.

Survival regression involves not only information about censorship and time to event, but also additional predictor variables of interest like the sex, age, race, etc. of an individual. Cox proportional hazards models is a popular and widely utilized modeling technique for survival data because it considers the effects of covariates on the outcome of interest as well as examines the relationships between these variables and the survival distribution. While this model is praised for its flexibility and simplicity, it is also often criticized for its restrictive proportional hazards assumption.

**The Proportional Hazards Assumption**

The **proportional hazards assumption** states that the relative hazard remains constant over time across the different strata/covariate levels in the data. The most popular graphical technique for evaluating the PH assumption involves comparing estimated **log-log survival curves** over different strata of the variables being investigated. A log-log survival curve is a transformation of an estimated survival curve that results from taking the natural log of an estimated survival probability twice. Generally, if the log-log survival curves are approximately parallel for each level of the covariates then the proportional hazard assumption is met.

![](img/PH_assumption_good.png){width="608"}

In the case of continuous covariates, this assumption can also be checked using statistical tests and graphical methods based on the scaled Schoenfeld residuals. The Schoenfeld residuals are calculated for all covariates for each individual experiencing an event at a given time. Those are the *differences* between that individual's covariate values at the event time and the corresponding risk-weighted average of covariate values among all individuals at risk. The Schoenfeld residuals are then scaled inversely with respect to their covariances/variances. We can think of this as down-weighting Schoenfeld residuals whose values are uncertain because of high variance. If the assumption is valid, the *Schoenfeld residuals* are independent of time. A plot that shows a non-random pattern against time is evidence of violation of the PH assumption. In summary, the proportional hazard assumption is supported by a non-significant relationship between residuals and time, and refuted by a significant relationship.

This is a strong assumption and is often viewed as impractical as it is more often than not violated. There are a number of extensions that aim to deal with data that violate this assumption, but they often rely on restrictive functions or limit the ability to estimate the effects of covariates on survival. **Random survival forests** provide an attractive non-parameteric alternative to these models.

## Review of Random Forests

## Random Survival Forests

Used to analyze time to event survival data.


Used to analyze time to event survival data.


Random survival forests use splitting criterion based on survival time and censoring status. Survival trees are binary trees which recursively split tree nodes so that the dissimilarity between child nodes is maximized. Eventually the dissimilar cases are separated and each node becomes more homogenous. The predictive outcome is defined as the total number of deaths, which is derived from the ensemble cumulative hazard function (CHF).

The algorithm:

1. Draw $B$ bootstrap samples from the data

2. Grow a survival tree for each bootstrap sample. For each node of the tree, consider $p$ random variables to split on. The node is split with the candidate variable which maximizes the survival difference between child nodes.

3. Grow the tree as long to full size and stop when the terminal node has no less than $d_0 > 0$ unique deaths. 

4. Average over $B$ survival trees to obtain the ensemble CHF.

5. Calculate the prediction error for the ensemble CHF using OOB error.

We determine a terminal node $h\in T$ when there are no less than  $d_0 > 0$ unique deaths. Let us define $d_{l,h}$ and $Y_{l,h}$ as the number of deaths and individuals who are at risk at time $t_{l,h}$. Then the CHF estimate for a terminal node $h$ is defined as 

$$
\hat{H}_h(t) = \sum_{t_{l,h} \le t} \frac{d_{l,h}}{Y_{l,h}}
$$

Each individual $i$ has a $d$ dimensional covariate $\mathbf{x}_i$. The binary structure of survival trees allows $\mathbf{x}_i$ to be classified into a unique terminal node $h$. Thus the CHF for individual $i$ is 

$$
H (t | \mathbf{x}_i) = \hat H_h(t), \ \text{ if } \mathbf{x}_i\in h.
$$

The ensemble CHF is found by averaging over <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B"> survival trees.

## Applications

### PBC Data

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is an autoimmune disease leading to destruction of the small bile ducts in the liver. Progression is slow but inexorable, eventually leading to cirrhosis and liver decompensation.

This data is from the Mayo Clinic trial in PBC conducted between 1974 and 1984. A total of 424 PBC patients met eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine. This dataset tracks survival status until end up follow up period as well as contains many covariates collected during the clinical trial.

**Variable Selection**

In order to choose the variables that we want to use in our models, we will first run a cox proportional hazards model with all of the possible main effects in our data. We will then go through a backwards elimination process, removing the variables with the highest p-values over a significance level of 0.05 one by one until all of the main effects are statistically significant. Then, we'll test for all two-way interaction terms and perform backwards elimination until all two-interactions left in the model are statistically significant.

Note that the status variable will be simplified to two levels. Individuals will have a value of 1 if they experienced death, and 0 otherwise, making **death our event of interest**.

```{r}

pbc_use <- pbc %>%
  mutate(status = as.integer(ifelse(status == 2, 1, 0))) %>%
  select(-id)

pbc_use$trt <- as.factor(pbc_use$trt)

pbc_use$ascites <- as.factor(pbc_use$ascites)

pbc_use$hepato <- as.factor(pbc_use$hepato)

pbc_use$spiders <- as.factor(pbc_use$spiders)

```

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# test main effects
pbc.main <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ ., data =  pbc_use)
step(pbc.main, direction = "backward")

```

```{r}

pbc.cox2 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ . - alk.phos, data = pbc_use)
pbc.cox3 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ . - alk.phos -
                    hepato, data = pbc_use)
pbc.cox4 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ . - alk.phos -
                    hepato - ascites, data = pbc_use)
pbc.cox5 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ . - alk.phos -
                    hepato - ascites - spiders, data = pbc_use)
pbc.cox6 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ . - alk.phos -
                    hepato - ascites - spiders -
                    trt, data = pbc_use)
pbc.cox7 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ . - alk.phos -
                    hepato - ascites - spiders -
                    trt - trig, data = pbc_use)
pbc.cox8 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ . - alk.phos -
                    hepato - ascites - spiders -
                    trt - trig - platelet, data = pbc_use)
pbc.cox9 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ . - alk.phos -
                    hepato - ascites - spiders -
                    trt - trig - platelet - sex, data = pbc_use)
pbc.cox10 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ . - alk.phos -
                    hepato - ascites - spiders -
                    trt - trig - platelet - sex -
                     chol, data = pbc_use)

pbc_use <- pbc_use %>%
  select(-c(alk.phos, hepato, ascites, spiders,
                    trt, trig, platelet, sex, chol))

```

```{r, results='hide', echo = TRUE}

# test two-way interactions
pbc.full <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ (.)^2, data =  pbc_use)
step(pbc.full, direction = "backward")

```

Going through backwards elimination leaves us with a model with age, edema status (edema), serum bilirunbin (bili), serum albumin (albumin), urine copper (copper), aspartate aminotransferase (ast), standardised blood clotting time (protime), histologic stage of disease (stage) and the interactions between age and edema status, age and urine copper, and serum bilirunbin and aspartate aminotransferase.

```{r, echo = TRUE}

pbc_cox <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ age + edema + bili + albumin + 
  copper + ast + protime + stage + age:edema + age:copper + 
  bili:ast, 
  data = pbc_use)

```

We can test the proportional-hazards assumption using the `cox.zph` function.

For each covariate, the function correlates the corresponding set of scaled Schoenfeld residuals with time to test for independence between residuals and time. Additionally, it performs a global test for the model as a whole.

```{r, echo = TRUE}

test.ph <- cox.zph(pbc_cox)
test.ph

```

```{r}

schoenplot1 <- ggcoxzph(test.ph)[3]
schoenplot2 <- ggcoxzph(test.ph)[7]
schoenplot3 <- ggcoxzph(test.ph)[11]

schoenplot1$`3`
schoenplot2$`7`
schoenplot3$`11`


```

The output from the test tells us that the test is statistically significant for bili, protime, and the interaction between bili and ast at a significance level of 0.05. It's also globally statistically significant with a p-value of 0.04. Thus, the PH assumption is violated.

Using random survival forests and conditional inference forests are useful alternatives in this case.

We'll start by splitting our data into a 75/25 training-testing set. Our training and testing sets have 313 and 105 observations respectively. *note small sample sizes?*

```{r}

set.seed(1)
train_ind_pbc <- sample(1:nrow(pbc_use), nrow(pbc_use)*0.75)
train_pbc <- pbc_use[train_ind_pbc,]
test_pbc <- pbc_use[-train_ind_pbc,]

```
